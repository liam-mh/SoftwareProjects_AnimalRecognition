# Elanco Dataset

This repository contains sample images to be used for analysis. For each animal group, there are up to 10 images.

There is an `example-results.txt` file for each animal group which contains examples of results returned from the sample images. While these are the type of results that are desired, they shouldn't be seen as a limit. Any additional information that can be extracted from the images is welcome.

Additional images can be used to expand this dataset. These images may be include different species or different scenarios.
